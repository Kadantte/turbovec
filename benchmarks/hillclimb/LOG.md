# Six-op hill-climb — results log

Objective: WHM of 12 per-cell speedups vs `benchmarks/results/hillclimb_baseline.json`
(weights search 3, insert 2, delete 2, save 1, load 1, load_search 0 — gate-only).
Win = target op HM(arm,x86) > x1.01, no target cell regressing, all other cells
within 3% noise, correctness + durability floor never traded. Stop: 20 consecutive
non-wins.

Bench: `benchmarks/hillclimb/bench_ops.py` (N=200k, dim=768, 4-bit). Smoke = 5 reps
both arches; soak = 15 reps. x86 = GCP c3-standard-8 (Sapphire Rapids).

Non-win streak: 0

## Baseline

(recording — 15 reps both arches)

## Hypotheses

### H1 — parallelize `seq_to_packed` (target: insert)

The first mutation after a v6 load materializes `packed_codes` from the blocked
cache via `pack::seq_to_packed`, a scalar single-threaded loop — 1.7 s ARM /
3.1 s x86 of the insert cell's total, and the same cost opens the delete cell.
Rows are independent → rayon over block-aligned row chunks, serial below 4 MB
(same threshold as `interleave_blocks_x86_in_place`).

- Smoke: pending
